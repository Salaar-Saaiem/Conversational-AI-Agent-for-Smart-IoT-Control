## ✅ Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Focus Area | Goals |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1 | 🧠 AI Basics + Bot Setup | Understand AI agent concepts + build Telegram bot + FastAPI |
| 2 | 🧠 LLM Integration + Intent Parsing | Connect OpenAI + parse natural language commands |
| 3 | 🔌 IoT Communication (MQTT) | Connect to device data (fake or real) via MQTT |
| 4 | 📡 Real-Time Monitoring Agent | Fetch & return sensor data via chat |
| 5 | 🧠 Rules + Condition Logic | Implement "if humidity > 70, turn off fan" logic |
| 6 | 🧪 Predictive Model (Optional) + Polish | Add failure prediction model + polish code, docs, and demo |

## WEEKLY PLAN (DETAILED)

### Week 1: 🧠 AI Agent + Bot Fundamentals
**Goal**: Understand how chat-based AI agents work and set up a basic bot pipeline.

- [ ] Learn what an AI agent is (reactive, goal-based, utility-based)
- [ ] Set up GitHub project and folder structure
- [ ] Create Telegram bot using BotFather
- [ ] Write Python backend using FastAPI
- [ ] Connect Telegram → FastAPI via webhook or polling
- [ ] Echo dummy messages

**Deliverable**: You can chat with your bot and receive replies.

---

### Week 2: 🧠 OpenAI Integration + Prompt Parsing
**Goal**: Make the bot smart using LLMs to understand natural language.

- [ ] Learn prompt engineering basics
- [ ] Connect OpenAI GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5) via API
- [ ] Parse user messages:
  - Intent (monitor, control)
  - Device (fan, light, pump)
  - Conditions (e.g., if humidity > 70)
- [ ] Create a prompt parser that returns structured JSON
- [ ] Handle errors and fallbacks

**Deliverable**:  
Example → `"Turn off the fan if temp > 30"`  
Parsed JSON → `{ action: "off", device: "fan", condition: "temp > 30" }`

---

### Week 3: 🔌 MQTT + IoT Communication
**Goal**: Build the communication bridge to your IoT devices.

- [ ] Learn MQTT basics: broker, topic, publish/subscribe
- [ ] Set up Mosquitto broker locally or via Docker
- [ ] Write MQTT handler to:
  - Subscribe to sensors (`temp`, `humidity`)
  - Publish control commands
- [ ] Create mock device script to simulate sensor readings

**Deliverable**: Chat command triggers action + simulated sensor sends data.

---

### Week 4: 📡 Real-Time Monitoring Agent
**Goal**: Let users ask for sensor values through chat.

- [ ] Store latest MQTT values in memory or DB
- [ ] On query like "What's the temperature?" → fetch latest value
- [ ] Handle variations like “How hot is it in Zone A?”
- [ ] Return clean, conversational responses

**Deliverable**: Bot replies with live device data on demand.

---

### Week 5: 🧠 Add Rule Engine + Logic
**Goal**: Allow dynamic rules like:
> “Turn on pump if temperature < 25 and humidity > 60”

- [ ] Store rule JSON in DB
- [ ] Match conditions in real-time as MQTT data flows in
- [ ] Trigger control commands when rule matches
- [ ] Log all actions and responses

**Deliverable**: Your bot enforces smart, user-defined rules.

---

### Week 6: 🧪 Predictive Maintenance + Final Polish
**Goal**: Add optional intelligence layer + polish everything.

- [ ] Train a model on logs (Prophet, LSTM)
- [ ] Predict future values or detect anomalies
- [ ] Add alert system: “Compressor may fail in 10 days”
- [ ] Finalize UI, diagrams, README, and testing
- [ ] Record demo video (if needed)

**Deliverable**: Full-stack system with AI, IoT, logic, chat, and prediction.
