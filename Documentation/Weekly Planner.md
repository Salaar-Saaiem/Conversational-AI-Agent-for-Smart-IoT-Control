# 🧱 Production-Grade Weekly Plan — AI-Based IoT Agent Suite

This 7-week roadmap covers everything needed to build, test, and deploy a production-level AI-powered IoT assistant that works via Telegram and integrates with MQTT-controlled devices.

---

## ✅ Weekly Breakdown

| Week | Focus Area | Goals |
|------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Telegram Webhook Bot | Setup bot with FastAPI and proper architecture |
| 2 | LLM + Prompt Parsing | Integrate OpenAI to parse commands into JSON |
| 3 | MQTT + Device Sim | Connect MQTT broker + mock device communication |
| 4 | Real-Time Monitoring | Query live device values via chat |
| 5 | Rule Engine | Trigger actions based on conditions like `if temp > 35` |
| 6 | Predictive Maintenance (Optional) | Forecast failures based on sensor history |
| 7 | CI/CD + Deploy + Monitor | Full production deployment and testing |

## 🧠 Week 1: Telegram Webhook Bot

**🎯 Goal:** Build a webhook-based Telegram bot with FastAPI and a modular backend.

### Tasks
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure
- [ ] Register Telegram bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
- [ ] Connect Telegram bot via **webhook**, not polling
- [ ] Load secrets using `.env`
- [ ] Create proper folder structure: `bot/`, `core/`, `api/`, `config/`
- [ ] Add basic `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore`
- [ ] Setup `logging` or `loguru` for structured logs

### Deliverable
Send message to Telegram bot → FastAPI route receives it → custom reply

---

## 🤖 Week 2: LLM + Prompt Parsing

**🎯 Goal:** Convert natural language into actionable commands using GPT.

### Tasks
- [ ] Connect OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5
- [ ] Build a clean `PromptParser` module
- [ ] Design few-shot or structured prompts
- [ ] Extract intent, device, action, condition
- [ ] Log prompts and responses
- [ ] Write unit tests for parsing

### Deliverable
Parse example:
{ "action": "turn_off", "device": "fan", "condition": { "parameter": "humidity", "operator": ">", "value": 70 } }

---

## 📡 Week 3: MQTT Integration + Device Simulation

**🎯 Goal:** Connect to a real MQTT broker and simulate devices.

### Tasks
- [ ] Use `paho-mqtt` to connect, publish, subscribe
- [ ] Run Mosquitto via Docker
- [ ] Build `mqtt_handler.py` with reconnects and error logging
- [ ] Write a fake device simulator that sends random sensor data
- [ ] Create real-time logs of MQTT traffic

### Deliverable
Chat command → control message via MQTT → device responds (mocked)

---

## 📊 Week 4: Real-Time Monitoring Agent

**🎯 Goal:** Ask the bot for live sensor values.

### Tasks
- [ ] Store latest values in Redis or memory cache
- [ ] Query handlers: “What’s the temp in Zone B?”
- [ ] Sanitize and standardize sensor names
- [ ] Format clean replies (units, location, etc.)
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks

### Deliverable
Bot replies with accurate, real-time device state

---

## ⚙️ Week 5: Rule Engine

**🎯 Goal:** Enable "if-this-then-that" logic in natural language.

### Tasks
- [ ] Build a `RuleManager` to store rules in DB
- [ ] When sensor data arrives, check against rules
- [ ] On match → trigger control command (MQTT publish)
- [ ] Log rule evaluations and actions taken
- [ ] Add endpoints to add/view/delete rules

### Deliverable
Rule created via chat → stored → enforced on live data

---

## 🔮 Week 6: Predictive Maintenance (Optional)

**🎯 Goal:** Forecast failures based on sensor logs.

### Tasks
- [ ] Store time-series data in DB
- [ ] Train ML model (Prophet, LSTM, or basic thresholding)
- [ ] Create background job to run predictions
- [ ] Alert user via chat if anomaly or risk detected
- [ ] Explain prediction in human-friendly terms

### Deliverable
Bot: “⚠️ Pump in Zone C may fail in 8 days (temp spikes detected)”

---

## 🚀 Week 7: CI/CD + Deployment + Monitoring

**🎯 Goal:** Finalize project for production deployment.

### Tasks
- [ ] Finalize `Dockerfile`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore`
- [ ] Setup CI/CD with GitHub Actions (tests, Docker build, linting)
- [ ] Deploy backend (Render / Railway / VPS)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS, domain, and bot webhooks
- [ ] Setup logging to file or external service (Sentry / Logtail)
- [ ] Polish `README.md`, add architecture diagram, dev docs

### Deliverable
End-to-end working, deployed, production-grade Telegram IoT agent
